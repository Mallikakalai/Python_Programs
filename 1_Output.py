#What is the expected output of the following python code given below:
data = [10,501,22,37,100,999,87,351]
result=filter(lambda x:x>4, data) #checking the list element with the condition element greater than 4
print(list(result))

#output- since all the list elements are greater than 4, it will print the same list of elements
